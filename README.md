# CtCI Questions

This repository contains a python file for each question in
[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
by [Gayle Lackmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/).

I have taken the work done by Gregory Clark in his repository
[ctci-solutions]https://github.com/w-hat/ctci-solutions and stripped away all solutions
leaving only the problem statement as a comment at the top.

Also included is 'delete_answers.py' which I created and executed in order to strip the
solutions from the other .py files.

Some files may be missing crucial information if that information was not commented out.
