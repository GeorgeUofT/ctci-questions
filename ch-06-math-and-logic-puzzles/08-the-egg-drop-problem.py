# What is the best floor to drop an egg from in an n-story building if you
# have k eggs left if you want to determine the highest floor from which an 
# egg can fall without breaking while minimizing the number of drops you
# must perform.  Assume a uniform distribution of breaking floors.
# Note that this differs slightly from the book's problem in that we want to
# minimize *average* drops rather than the worst case scenario.
